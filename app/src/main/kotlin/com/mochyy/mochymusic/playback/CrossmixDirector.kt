/**
 * Runs Crossmix transitions: analyses the song and the next one, plans the hand-over, then plays
 * it on two players.
 *
 * The rule throughout is that a transition either happens properly or not at all. The next song
 * is prepared silently well ahead; only once it's actually ready is the outgoing side touched, and
 * if it isn't ready in time the song simply ends and the next one starts as it always did. The
 * next player starts slightly early by a measured amount and its beat is then locked to the
 * outgoing one by a small delay inside its renderer, mostly while it's still silent. Tempo is set
 * once before it starts and eased back after the overlap, never moved while both are playing,
 * because Media3 drains and resets the whole audio chain on every speed change.
